## How to import **Mule Application** solution into Studio?

- Download the solution .jar file

- Start **Anypoint Studio**

- **Note**: If the Studio's workspace already contains a project with the same name that you plan to import, right-click on the project and _delete_ it first (don't forget to select the _checkmark_ to delete it from the filesystem as well)

- Within **Package Explorer** section (top-left), right-click anywhere in white space, select **Import** to open the wizard

- Within **Import** wizard, expand **Anypoint Studio > Packaged Mule application (jar)** and click **Next**

- Browse and select the .jar file that you downloaded, and click **Finish**

- Wait till all necessary dependencies are downloaded (progress is indicated at the bottom-right corner of Studio)

- That's it.  Now, you are ready to either add more content or run and test the mule app
